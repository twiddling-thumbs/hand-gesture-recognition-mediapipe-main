In this project I have be built a model on sign language detection that takes the dataset in real time from the camera and then apply the required preprocessing techniques to filter out all the unnecessary information from the image data after that the pre-processed data is passed through a classifier which predicts the class of the hand gestures. Signs are detected using MediaPipe.
